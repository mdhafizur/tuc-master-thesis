## 🏗️ Architecture & Diagrams

### System Architecture

Code Guardian uses a layered architecture for optimal performance and maintainability:

**6 Core Layers:**

1. **User Interface Layer** - VS Code editor integration, status bar, quick fixes
2. **Extension Core Layer** - Command handling, event management, VS Code API
3. **Intelligence & Analysis Layer** - Security analysis, caching, RAG, workspace scanning
4. **External Data Sources** - NVD, OWASP, CWE, GitHub APIs (165+ vulnerability entries)
5. **AI Processing Layer** - Ollama LLM server with 20+ models, embeddings
6. **Webview Presentation Layer** - Interactive dashboards, Q&A UI, visualizations

**Key Components:**

- **Analysis Cache (LRU)**: 95-98% hit rate, crypto-based hashing
- **RAG Manager**: Vector store with HNSWlib for semantic knowledge search
- **Vulnerability Data Manager**: Real-time CVE/OWASP/CWE updates (24h cache)
- **Workspace Scanner**: Concurrent file analysis with progress tracking
- **Dashboard Generator**: Security scoring (0-100, A-F), heatmap visualization

**Performance Features:**

- Smart caching reduces LLM calls by 95-98%
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- Debounced real-time analysis (800ms)
- Lazy loading for heavy components (RAG)

### Complete Diagrams
