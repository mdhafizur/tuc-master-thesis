Building on the conceptual architecture introduced in the previous chapter, this section moves from theory to implementation and demonstrates how the multi-agent pipeline was realized in practice. It details the chosen technologies, system workflow, concrete agent implementations, and the execution of the four architectural strategies. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key design decisions and challenges encountered during development.
