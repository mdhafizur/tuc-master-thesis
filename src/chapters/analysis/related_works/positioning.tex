In contrast to prior work, this thesis focuses explicitly on privacy-preserving vulnerability detection and repair using locally deployed LLMs integrated into Visual Studio Code. The proposed system combines retrieval-augmented reasoning with IDE-level context extraction to support both real-time and on-demand security analysis for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. Unlike fine-tuned or cloud-dependent approaches, the system operates entirely offline, decouples security knowledge from model parameters, and is evaluated against established SAST baselines using reproducible benchmarks and quantitative metrics.

By addressing detection consistency, contextual reasoning, explainability, actionable repair, privacy preservation, and usability within a unified framework, this work aims to bridge the gap between academic advances in LLM-based security analysis and the practical requirements of real-world software development workflows.
