I am grateful to everyone who supported me during this Master’s thesis.

My sincere thanks go to my internal supervisor, \textit{Abubaker Gaber, M.Sc.}, for his continuous guidance, constructive feedback, and thoughtful discussions throughout the project. His support was essential in shaping both the technical direction and the academic quality of this work.

I also thank the academic staff of the Master’s program for providing a strong foundation and a stimulating learning environment.

I am equally thankful to my colleagues and peers for their encouragement and for creating a supportive atmosphere during the study period.

Most of all, I thank my family for their patience, trust, and constant encouragement. Their support made it possible for me to complete this thesis.
